# Practical Promises

In this workshop, we'll be covering how use promises for asynchronous control flow by using them to log out poem stanzas.

Follow the exercises in `exercise-one.js` and `exercise-two.js`. Each exercise includes a description of its objective as well as an example of a solution using vanilla async callbacks. For each exercise, come up with an equivalent solution using promises.

Execute your code with: `node exercise-one` or `node exercise-two`. As you go through, we recommend you comment out the code for any exercise you are not currently working on. This will clear up your console output.

We will be using the bluebird promise library, and you'll likely find [its documentation](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md) helpful.
